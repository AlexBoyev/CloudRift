# CloudRift

**CloudRift** is a full-stack application that implements various data structures and algorithms as microservices. Each microservice is written in a different programming language, running within containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. The project demonstrates modern DevOps practices, containerization, and cloud-native development.

## Features

* **Multi-language Microservices**: Each microservice represents an algorithm (e.g., linked lists, trees, stacks) written in different languages like Java, Python, and C.
* **Kubernetes Orchestration**: All microservices run in containers managed by Kubernetes for scalability and resilience.
* **Git & Jenkins Integration**: Git for version control and Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
* **API Communication**: Microservices communicate via REST APIs.
* **Database Management**: A centralized database manages shared data across microservices.
* **Web-Based UI**: Users can interact with and visualize algorithm operations via a responsive web interface.
